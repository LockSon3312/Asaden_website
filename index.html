        <h1> AsaDen, The best romance of modern Shonen?</h1>
        <h2>(who am i kidding?, they are)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Chainsaw man is a Shonen manga series created by tatsuki fujimoto. i would not be sumarizing its wikipedia page (everyone reading this here already knows) but just you know its a violent series that include some heavy themes and manages to convey the messages it wants with such precision its astonishing.</p> <br>
        <p>the focus point of this entire unofficial website is the romantical relashionship of Our Protagonist, Asa Mitaka. With our previus Protagonist, Denji Hayakawa </p> <br>

        <h3>Denji, the phisical victim</h3>
        <p>Our examination begins with the character of Denji Hayakawa. Denji suffered a life of misery when he was a kid, had little to no education and given that he lived in the countryside of Japan and he has barely any emotional intelligence. Denji has stated multiple times throughout the story that he wants to have sex. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't understand that he doesn't really want sex, he just wants a romantic partner and he chases any woman that gives him the minimal amount of affection (he's just like me, for real). After the end of Part 1, he's a more mature person and has the responsibility of taking care of his daughter/little sister called Nayuta.</p> <br>
        <p>i won't take the bother to resume the entire Chainsaw-Man Part 1 here, all you here know this man</p> <br>

        <h3>Asa Mitaka, the psicological victim</h3>
        <p>We continue to the character examination we look at our current protagonist. Asa is a 16 year old high school student with self-steem issues and depression (and is quite probably autistic in some range of the spectrum, but there is no confirmation as of rigth now), her mother died many years ago thanks to a devil attack and has ever since living alone, she strugles with social interactions a lot and has almost reclused heselfo from talking to people until she meets the War devil, Yoru. who decides to take her as a horstage of her own body in her mission to kill Chainsaw-Man</p><br>

        <h3>Forever is only the first step</h3>
